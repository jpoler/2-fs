A call to v.push(i) may or may not allocate depending on the algorithm used by
vec. If it's table doubling, the allocations would only happen every power of
two. Anyway, if push(i) needed more memory, it would call alloc with a layout of
twice the size, copy over the lower half, and then insert the element into the
next available slot. As far as the actual stack trace:

push
RawVec::double
(Bump)Allocator::alloc
