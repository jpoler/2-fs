Since we don't provide libc malloc with the type of the object that we are
allocating for, it must try to make the object aligned for it's size, whatever
that may be. On 64-bit architectures, there are long doubles, which can be 128
bits (16-bytes) on some systems. Since in many cases that is the largest
primitive type (excluding SIMD), this is the alignment that malloc chooses to
use to cover all of the possibilities.
