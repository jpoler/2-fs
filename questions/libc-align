The reason libc aligns on 16-byte boundaries are non-obvious without being
familiar with the implementation of malloc. The reason for these alignments is
because on 32 and 64-bit systems, this alignment holds two usize integers. This
allows for the instrusive linked-list pointer to the next list element, and a
size. Since those two bits of information are essential for bookkeeping, that's
the minimum size/alignment that malloc returns, otherwise it couldn't fit the
information free blocks.
