Find the correct partition:
- find the FAT partition by looking in the MBR for something of partition type 0b or 0c

- check byte 510, 11 for 0xAA55

Take the following information from BPB:
- bytes per sector (offset 11, size 2)
- sectors per cluster( offset 13, size 1)
- cluster size = bytes per sector * sectors per cluster
- reserved sectors (BPB and EPBP included)
- number of FATs

From EBPB:
- sectors per FAT
- cluster number of root directory

Now for start of clusters:
in sectors:
- partition offset + 1 sector (EPBP) + # reserved sectors + (# FATS * sectors/FAT)

root dir cluster start:
- cluster start + (cluster size * (root # - 2))

- read through directory entries looking for a.
- compute cluster offset of a
- read through a
- compute cluster offset of b
- read through b
- compute cluster offset of c
