We would have to manage a whole seperate region of memory for linked list
headers. This would end up being less efficient, since we are able to store the
linked list information in areas that are not being used, so there's very little
overhead. The main cost is that we have to allocate at least 16-bytes, instead
of being able to only allocate 2 bytes, for instance. In practice heap
allocation of 2-bytes wouldn't make a lot of sense.
