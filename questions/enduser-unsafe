This seems like a pretty common-sense thing to do. It cordons the unsafe code to
under the module API. That way, we can audit that code closely and not worry
about potential blowups coming from code elsewhere. Also, it is much more likely
that the module creator understands the unsafe properties of the code and edge
cases, so it is more likely that they will get it right.
