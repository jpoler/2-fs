Allowing the user to provide the layout gives much more flexiblity to specify
exactly how the allocated memory is layed out. For instance, it could be that
the user wants a two-byte alignment instead of 8 or 16. This would not be
possible with libc malloc.

Speculatively, it also might allow the allocator to simplify it's code, and in
some cases may be safer. This is because (I think) malloc stores information on
each block right next to the data, in the midst of the heap. Memory write
overflows due to lack of bounds checking can corrupt the heap and be bad news
for all users of the allocator. Obviously, this is restricted to within an
address space.
